# Introduction

A time-boxed security audit of the **protocol name** protocol was done by **auditor**, with a focus on the security aspects of the smart contracts through ProAudits.

# Disclaimer

Audits are a time, resource and expertise bound effort where trained experts evaluate smart contracts using a combination of automated and manual techniques to find as many vulnerabilities as possible. Audits can show the presence of vulnerabilities but not their absence.
